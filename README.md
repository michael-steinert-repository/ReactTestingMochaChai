# Automated Tests

# Advantages 
* Avoid Regression, that means what has already worked should continue to work by running the Tests
* Quick Feedback on Functionality
* Tests are technical Documentation

## What is needed for testing in Javascript
* Testrunner - Mocha: A Testrunner is a Library that searches for and executes the Tests
* Assertion Library - Chai: A Assertion Library performs the Comparisons of Inputs and Outputs with expected Values
* Eventually Mocking Framework
